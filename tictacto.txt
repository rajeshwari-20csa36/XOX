Tic-Tac-Toe game (also called Noughts and Crosses)
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, 
who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.

In the following example, the first player (X) wins the game in seven steps:

Game of Tic-tac-toe, won by X
There is no universally agreed rule as to who plays first,
 but in this article the convention that X plays first is used.

Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. 
Hence, tic-tac-toe is often played by young children who may not have discovered the optimal strategy.

Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, 
it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and
 the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. 
 
 It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or
  to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or
   the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space.
   
   [3] If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.[4]
